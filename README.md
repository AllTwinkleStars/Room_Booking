### Installation
Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/julia-/room-booking-system
```

Change to the `api` folder and install development and production dependencies.

```
cd api
yarn install
```

Change to the `web` folder and install development and producation dependencies.
```
cd web
yarn install
```

You will need to set up MongoDB. See [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/) for instructions.

Seed the data
```
yarn seed
```

Go to the `api` folder and start the server.
```
cd api
yarn dev
```

Go to the `web` folder and run the script start script.
```
cd api
yarn start
```

Open in your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You access the back-end on http://localhost:7000.

## About project
You are to design, build, deploy, and present an application built for a real world customer.

Find a business or organisation nearby to Coder Academy to build an application for.

Meet with the business owner or organisation manager to find out what challenges they face. Find a problem that you can solve with an application and present your ideas to the client.

### Problem
The client has forty rooms over two floors available for use by staff, teachers and students. The booking of these rooms is currently managed using a basic spreadsheet system. This method is inflexible, cumbersome and does not allow for a high degree of specificity with respect to booking times. It also does not give the client a clear understanding of how their rooms are used and how the use of these resources can be optimised.
### Solution
A web-based application that allows the client (including its administrative staff, teachers and students) to login from anywhere to easily, accurately and quickly make room bookings.

This will help to ensure that room resources are used as fully-utilised as possible, whilst avoiding double-bookings and other common user frustrations. It will also make room booking statistics available to the client's staff and management to assist their planning and decision-making.

## Planning
We began the planning process by meeting with the client to better understand the problem and to see how the existing system worked. We also gathered information about what the client would like to expect in the new system. We then looked at other booking systems on Hotel websites and room booking systems used by libraries such as LibCal.

From then we began thinking about what documents and fields would be needed for the database and how we could nest or reference data from the documents. While developing the ERD, we also started working out how we could best display the data to avoid the problems that the client has with the existing system. We developed wireframes for day, week and month view and a prototype using Figma.

Using Trello we began adding all tasks and delegating work between each member of the team.
